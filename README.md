# Hello!

This is a 2D unity project where I remake, alone, the game we made during the Ludum Dare gamejam #47 (2020). 
The theme was "Stuck in a loop".

The game is simple, you're a little character that needs to go from a point A to B. The thing is... 
Everytime you finishes the level, you restart the level but the terrain changes a bit, allowing you to choose a different path.

This repo contains the source code for the remake version of this game, but feel free to check the original itch.io webpage: https://oceane-famechon.itch.io/murphys-escape
